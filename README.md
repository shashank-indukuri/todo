## Summary

This is a simple React based To-Do app currently in the initial stage without using Bootstrap

## Features
- Using their username and password, users may login or register (authentication is not yet implemented).

- After successfully logging in, a user can create a todo using the form located beneath the logout bar.

- Using React hooks, state is maintained around the components and the generated todo is rendered dynamically.

- The user may change the checkbox for each todo in order to indicate it as done.

- If the checkbox is set to true, the date completed is automatically mapped to the object.

-Finally, hitting Logout clears the state and allows another user to login.
